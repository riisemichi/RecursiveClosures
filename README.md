# RecursiveClosures
Library to make recursive closures easy in Swift.

## Why this Library?
Defining a recursive function in Swift is easy:

```swift
func fib(n: Int) {
    return n <= 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}
 
println(fib(3)) // 8
```
But how about defining a recursive closure?

```swift
let fib : (Int) -> Int = { n in
   n <= 2 ? 1 : fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}
```
In Swift 3.0 this produces the following error: ```error: variable used within its own initial value```

### With RecursiveClosures you can do the following:

```swift
let fib = Recursion<Int, Int> { (n, f) in
   n <= 2 ? 1 : f(n-1) + f(n-2)
}.closure
```
## Requirements
iOS 8, Swift 3.0

## Installation
###CocoaPods
```ruby
pod 'RecursiveClosures' => git: 'https://github.com/riisemichi/RecursiveClosures.git', tag: => '0.0.1'
```
### Carthage

### Use Class
You can even simply copy the class Recursion to your Project.

## Usage
Recursion is a generic class which takes two Types. One for parameter type, one for return type. Inside the closure you will have a parameter f, which represents the function itself, that can be called recursively.


```swift
// Create Closure
let fib = Recursion<Int, Int> { (n, f) in
   n <= 2 ? 1 : f(n-1) + f(n-2)
}.closure

// Run it
fib(6)
```

Need multiple parameters or return values? Just use Tuples. Example:

```swift
// DIN-A
let a = Recursion<Int, (Int, Int)> { (i, f) -> (Int, Int) in
    if i <= 0 {
        return (1189, 841)
    }
    let (h, w) = f(i-1)
    return (w / 2, h)
}.closure

a(6)
```

###Cached Recursion
CachedRecursion optimizes your closure by caching already calculated values. Your function will only be executed for a parameter if it is not found in the cache.

Just add a .cached before the .closure.


```swift
// Create Closure
let fib = Recursion<Int, Int> { (n, f) in
   n <= 2 ? 1 : f(n-1) + f(n-2)
}.cached.closure

// Run it
fib(60) //1548008755920
```

Using the cached version will even calculate a fibonacci of 60 lightning fast.

### EmojiCode
If you like it fancy, you can use the Emoji "ðŸŒ€" instead of "Recursion" (typealias).

```
let fib = ðŸŒ€<Int, Int> { (n, f) in
   n <= 2 ? 1 : f(n-1) + f(n-2)
}.cached.closure
```
